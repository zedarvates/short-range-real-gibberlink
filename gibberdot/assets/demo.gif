Demo placeholder - GibberDot communication between two devices
Frame 1: Two devices in idle state (LEDs off)
Frame 2: Device A initiates (blue LED fixed)
Frame 3: Device B listens (blue LED slow blink)
Frame 4: Ultrasonic transmission (40kHz burst)
Frame 5: Optical acknowledgment (LED flash)
Frame 6: Key exchange active (LEDs blinking)
Frame 7: Success state (green LED flashes 6x)
Frame 8: Secure communication established

[GIF animation showing the complete GibberDot handshake sequence]
- Device A: Arduino Nano with ultrasonic transducer
- Device B: Arduino Nano with ultrasonic transducer  
- Communication: 40kHz ultrasonic + RGB LED signaling
- Time: ~280ms handshake completion
- Security: AES-128 session key established
- Power: <15mA peak consumption
