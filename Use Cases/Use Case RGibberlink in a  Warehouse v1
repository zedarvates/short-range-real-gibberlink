🏭 Use Case: RGibberlink in a Confidential Warehouse
⚠️ Problem
• 	RF congestion: too many devices competing for spectrum → interference, unreliability.
• 	Faraday effect (shielding): warehouse structure blocks or attenuates radio signals.
• 	Confidentiality: RF emissions must be minimized to avoid leaks or surveillance.

🔐 Gibberlink Solution
• 	Visual channel (QR / coded symbols):
• 	Robots display task payloads on e‑paper or LCD panels.
• 	Nearby robots or stations read them with cameras.
• 	Ultrasonic channel (sync + anti‑replay):
• 	Provides nonce, timing, and MAC validation.
• 	Ensures payload authenticity and prevents replay attacks.
• 	Human validation (optional):
• 	Supervisors can approve tasks via PIN + checkboxes.
• 	Useful for sensitive operations (moving restricted goods, entering secure zones).

🤖 Robot-to-Robot Task Sharing
• 	Task assignment: One robot displays a QR with encoded job (e.g., “Move pallet to zone B”).
• 	Validation: Ultrasonic burst ensures the QR is fresh and authentic.
• 	Execution: Receiving robot accepts the task, logs it, and performs the action.
• 	Audit: Each handoff is signed and stored locally for later review.

🛡️ Advantages
• 	No RF dependency: Works in shielded or RF‑restricted environments.
• 	Directional & local: Hard to intercept outside the immediate area (<1 m).
• 	Confidential: Payloads are encrypted, short‑lived, and logged offline.
• 	Scalable: Multiple robots can coordinate without central radio infrastructure.

📦 Example Scenarios
• 	Warehouse logistics: Robots assign each other pallet moves, patrols, or restocking tasks.
• 	Sensitive storage: Access to restricted areas validated via badge + Gibberlink handshake.
• 	Quarantine zones: Unauthorized robots denied tasks, isolated automatically.
• 	Fleet coordination: Optimus‑type robots share workload securely without RF chatter.
